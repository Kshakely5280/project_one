## future Development and Challenges
Two page setup: We attempted to redirect our page not so much for necessity, but more of an “if we can”.  With our original idea we had preset cards to contain our information, and wanted to hide them on a separate webpage prior to displaying the results of the search. Our main hang-up was transferring the searched information to the new page and running our functions to display properly. With more time we feel like we could have resolved this by creating new functions that pull data from the local storage as opposed to our search area. 
Functioning API’s: Our plans for the app had changed several times based on the abilities of the API’s we found. For example, originally we wanted to display “dream housing” in an area with excellent weather based on the users search criteria. Ie: i want to live in a place with an average temperature of 72 degrees. We quickly learned that while it may be possible, it had far too many variables to account for. We found limitations on our Zillow API as well, after far too much work on the functioning API to work we found we were limited to 20 calls per day. 
With additional time an added map API to provide directions to the busy user exploring a new or familiar part of the city. 
We would have liked to add a “Favorites” list to reference as well for convenience to the user.
